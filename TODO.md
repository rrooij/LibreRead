TODO
====

- [ ] Rename application to LibreRead or something else
- [ ] Think about social media features (friends?)
- [ ] Should the user's book list be encrypted, for privacy measures?
- [ ] Layouts
- [ ] Federalized: can this application turn into a federalized web application that can communicate with other servers
      much like GNU Social.
